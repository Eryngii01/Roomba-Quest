# Roomba-Quest

This project was my submission to Develop At Ubisoft's (DAU) 2023 programming challenge hosted by Ubisoft Toronto that achieved 3rd place!
The task was to take DAU's starter API consisting of simple functions to draw lines, controller input handlers, render sprites, 
play single audio clips, and create a game with it and a provided theme in 2 1/2 days!

This competition took place from January 13 when the theme was released after noon to January 15, in which the theme was
"Space Exploration" and applicants were prompted to create any game using the directional buttons and any other single button of choice.

I am extremely overjoyed and proud to have become a finalist for this competition and would love to express my sincere gratitude to the
judges and Early Career Programs Team at Ubisoft Toronto for supporting me throughout the process! I have truly learned a lot in the span
of those few days, pushing my brain to its limits and exploring unknown territory in learning C++ (it was quite the hurdle to 
overcome but extremely fun :) ) within the week prior in preparation for this event. 

A video link is included with this submission to a video applicants were required to submit alongside the code to explore the gameplay
and describe the features we had successfully accomplished within the given time period.

I hope you enjoy this little quirky game! :)
